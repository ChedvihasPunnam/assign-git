2)What does fast-forward in git mean? 
Using fast-forward merge we can reach the target branch from the current branch
by moving the pointer forward from current branch to target branch.

3)Why should you have different branches? 
While working together in a team on same project, it is common to share and work on the same source code.
So, when there is some base version on master branch, different developers implement diffrent features from this code base.
So, in this situation branching helps developers to isolate their work from others.

 Project can have as many remote repositories as they want depending on the team requirement.
